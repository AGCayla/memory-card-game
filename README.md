## Instructions

Click on a card, and try to find its matching one. After flipping the first card, the timer will start and the program will start counting your moves. Flipping two cards will make one move. Try and match all cards as quick as possible and with as few tries as you can. This will dictate you score (3, 2, or 1 star).


## Dependencies
None. This program has been coded in pure HTML5, CSS3, and ES6.
